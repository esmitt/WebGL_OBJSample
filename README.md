# Single OBJ Loader using WebGL 

This is a testing code which load several OBJ files (inside the repo) and show them into a webpage using WebGL. Some OBJ files contain textures as images (PNG and JPG).

[Sylvester] is used as matrix manipulation. [dat.gui] as controller library (a panel with widgets, sliders, buttons, etc.) 

Shaders are inside the `index.html` file.

I used [QuickPHP] as web server, which is mandatory to load files into browser. 

Until now, only was tested on Firefox.
